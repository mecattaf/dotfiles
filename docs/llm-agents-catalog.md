# llm-agents.nix — installed product sweep

The `llm-agents.nix` flake input (`overlays.default` → `pkgs.llm-agents.*`)
exposes a ~139-product catalog. It was first adopted as a **maximalist sweep**
— install every buildable member — but that surfaced a great many programs
neither wanted nor needed on the desktop.

**Pruned to an allowlist (2026-07-12).** `home/home.nix` now installs only the
handful below via the `llmAgentsSelected` buildEnv; `keepFromLlmAgents` is the
allowlist. Agents upstream adds no longer land automatically — adding one is a
deliberate edit to that list. To keep/cut, edit `keepFromLlmAgents`, not a
denylist.

**Kept from the catalog (7):** `claude-code`, `ccusage`, `ck`,
`claude-agent-acp`, `qmd`, `pi`, `codex`.

**Kept, but NOT from this catalog:** `backlog-md` — built from our bespoke
`pkgs/backlog-md.nix` (bin `backlog`) and deliberately excluded from
`keepFromLlmAgents` so it isn't double-loaded / colliding on the same binary.

Everything else below is **cut**. The full list is retained as a snapshot of
what the catalog offered at adoption time.
